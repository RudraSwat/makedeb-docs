# Introduction
Welcome to the makedeb docs!

makedeb is a program for creating and installing Debian archives directly from PKGBUILDs, allowing Debian package maintainers to use Arch's [PKGBUILD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) format natively on Debian systems to build and package their programs for APT.

To get started, head over to the [setup instructions](/intro/setup.md).
