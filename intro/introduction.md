# Introduction
makedeb is a package suite for creating Debian archives from PKGBUILDs.

Through the use of all the tools, it's possible to install a variety of packages native to Arch Linux packages directly on Debian-based systems.

The makedeb suite also allows Debian package maintainers to use Arch's PKGBUILD format natively on Debian systems to build and package their programs.
