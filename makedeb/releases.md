makedeb has two release channels, `stable` and `alpha`. The two serve to help bring changes to users gradually, alleviating any sudden changes that could break a user's installation.

`stable` is the tested, known-to-work build of makedeb. This build receives changes whenever they're deemed to be safe, and is ready for production use.

`alpha` is the bleeding-edge version of makedeb. This build is created as soon as changes are pushed, resulting in a package that constantly gets new features. Users of this release should be ready (and expect) for breakage from time to time.
