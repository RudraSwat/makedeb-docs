{% hint style="warning" %}
The MUR currently requires version `5.0.0` or newer of makedeb. Currently, this means you'll need to use either the [beta or alpha](/makedeb/releases.md) release.
{% endhint %}

To use the MUR, you must first have [makedeb](/makedeb/intro.md) installed on your system.

The MUR is also designed first and foremost for Debian systems, and there is thus no guarantee on usability for Arch-based distributions.

To begin using the MUR, head over to the [MUR homepage](https://dur.hunterwittenborn.com), and create an account.

Users who need help using the MUR can reference the Arch Wiki article on the [AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository). Specifically, see sections 4, 5, 6, and 8.

Users who need additional help can also reach out in the support rooms (links available in the header).
