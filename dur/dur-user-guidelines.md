The DUR User Guidelines are based on [those of the AUR](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_User_Guidelines). In addition to those rules, the following restrictions are in place:

---



Do **NOT** publish PKGBUILDs for packages in the makedeb package suite (this only includes [makedeb](/makedeb/intro.md), [mpm](/mpm/intro.md), [makedeb-db](/makedeb-db/intro.md), and makepkg). If we wanted them on the DUR, we would add them ourselves.

Do **NOT** pull packages from Debian, Ubuntu, or any other distro's repositories that don't use the latest version of any said package.
